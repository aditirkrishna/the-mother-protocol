# CHAPTER 01 — THE FILING ROOM  
_(as dictated by rhyl, who may or may not be hallucinating this into a cracked iPhone at 3 AM while eating cold ramen with scissors.)_

The air tastes like wet paperbacks left in a basement and apologies nobody ever spat out. Thick. Cloying. Like swallowing regret whole.  
If grief had a corporate HQ? This filing room would be its sad little breakroom.  
Fluorescent lights buzzing like angry hornets trapped behind frosted glass. The kind of place where optimism goes to chain-smoke behind the dumpster.

It’s always **10:42 PM** here.  
Not because the clock’s broken (though it is, metaphorically, like my therapist’s will to live),  
but because something decided this is when forgetting feels the most like routine.  
Mundane annihilation. Peak existential witching hour.  
Perfect.

Selin’s Converse leave zero echo. As if the floor absorbs sound out of sheer spite.  
Everything else compensates. The air thrums, a low C-sharp of withheld confessions.  
The rows of steel cabinets wheeze like asthmatic librarians as she passes.  
“Posture, dear,” they rasp. “Slouching invites narrative complications.”  
Assholes.

One overhead light sputters.  
Not broken. Philosophical.  
Contemplating the void but still punching the clock. Mood, kindred fluorescent spirit. Solidarity.  
We’ve all stared into the abyss while contemplating unpaid bills.

**Files. Endless. Relentless.**  
Shelved alphabetically by a system designed by Kafka on a bad day.  
- A: Abandonment Issues  
- B: Broken Promises (Recurring)  
- C: Catastrophic Thinking  
- D: Daddy Issues (See also: Unresolved)

An archive allergic to closure.

Her hand hovers. Trembles. Not fear. Anticipation?  
Or maybe just the ghost of too much caffeine on an empty stomach.   
Tuesday? Wednesday? Calendars are fascist constructs anyway.  
She grabs a folder. Thick. Cold. Like holding a slab of frozen lake.

- SUBJECT: SELIN M
- STATUS: ACTIVE YET UNDOCUMENTED (Me on every dating profile ever)
- REVISIONS: INFINITE (My therapist’s billing cycle)
- MEMORY RECALL: UNRELIABLE (SEE: ADHD, TRAUMA, GENERAL DISASSOCIATIVE VIBES)
- MOTHER: UNSPECIFIED / UNSTABLE (SEE ADDENDUM: “THE VOID WHERE AFFECTION SHOULD BE”)
- PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE: WITHDRAWN (Me exiting group chat)


Flip. A photo. Not her. A stick figure drawing. Third grade.  
Holding a giant, lopsided question mark like a wilted balloon on a string.  
Stapled ruthlessly to a psychiatric evaluation typed on paper the color of institutional despair:

> “Subject exhibits persistent pattern-seeking behavior within emotionally sterile environments.  
> Interprets prolonged silence as implicit instruction, often of a self-destructive nature.  
> Caution: May assign anthropomorphic qualities to office supplies.”  
> _(Translation: Girl sees ghosts in IKEA showrooms. Sobs at voicemail beeps.)_

She slams it shut. The sound cracks like a frozen branch.  
Opens another. This one *hums*. A low, discordant vibration up her arm.  
Like holding a beehive full of anxious thoughts.  
She presses it to her ear — a conch shell whispering secrets from the Sea of Oh-God-Why.

> “Seh-linnnn…” (Clinical detachment. Cold.)  
> “Saaaail-in…” (Like a ghost ship lost in fog. Haunting.)  
> “Sellllf-in…” (A hiss. Too accurate. Ouch.)

Fifth file: Utterly blank. Just… white space. A visual scream.  
Sixth: Bleeds thick, dark ink when her finger brushes the label.  
Stains her skin like a Rorschach test for regret.  
Seventh: Technical diagram labeled “Standard Maternal Unit.”  
Face aggressively pixelated. Like the universe got a DMCA takedown notice on motherhood itself.

> “Why keep this shit here?”  
> Her voice, rusty. Unused. “In this… tomb for feelings?”  
> A drawer slides open an inch nearby with a metallic **schiiick**.  
> Dust motes dance in the weak light.  
> A voice, dry as forgotten bones:  
> “Storage is cheaper than remembering, sweetheart. And you opted for the budget plan.”  
>
> **Fuck.** It’s always the inanimate objects that read you to filth. 
> **Fuck.** Even the furniture gaslights her. Peak efficiency.

Selin folds. Collapses onto the linoleum. Lets her spine surrender like a bridge made of wet spaghetti.  
Tired. So tired of performing structural integrity.  
Her hands shake — not adrenaline, just the aftershocks of memory. Or maybe hypoglycemia.

Her reflection stares back from the polished steel cabinet face.  
Distorted. Pixelated. Low-resolution.  
Like a JPEG of a person downloaded from Tumblr in 2012.  
**High-definition archive, low-fidelity self.**

Then. A flicker. Cardstock.  
Stark white against the industrial grey. Wedged in the cabinet rail like a smuggled note.  
She pries it free. Reads:

> “RETURN ALL UNSOLICITED FEELINGS TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  
> NO REFUNDS. NO EXCHANGES.”  
> — THE MOTHER PROTOCOL, LINE 0 _(Terms & Conditions Apply)_

She flips it. Blank. Flips again:

> **You.**

Lights stutter. Flicker-die-flicker-rebirth.  
The drawer beside her exhales a long, metallic sigh.  
**Schuuuuck-click.** Something unseen latches shut.  
Something that wasn’t open before.  
Or maybe it always was.  
**Semantics.**

**10:42 PM.**  
Relentless. Stuck.  
She hadn’t known what she was hunting for.  
But the cold certainty coils in her gut:  
Whatever it was, it wouldn’t leave this room with her.  
Nothing good ever did.  
Only the ghosts. The pixelation. The hum.

> Fits neatly in a pocket next to the lint and loose change._

## INTERLUDE: SELIN VS. THE VENDING MACHINE OF REGRET

There’s a vending machine. Of course there is.  
It doesn’t vend snacks. It vends **miniature traumas**.  
Convenience-sized sorrows. Lit by a sickly green glow.

**Labels include:**

- A3: THAT TIME YOU WET YOUR PANTS IN 2ND GRADE _(REFRESHING!)_  
- B7: THE SOUND OF YOUR PARENTS ARGUING THROUGH WALLS _(SUSTENANCE PACK)_  
- C1: THE LOOK ON HIS FACE WHEN HE LEFT _(LOW CALORIE, HIGH IMPACT)_  
- D4: THE FEELING YOU’RE FUNDAMENTALLY UNLOVABLE _(FAMILY VALUE SIZE)_

Selin stares. Her stomach growls. Not for food. For something.  
She inserts a single, tarnished quarter from 1987.  
The machine whirs. Then spits out nothing. Just a slip of thermal paper.

> “INSUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR SELECTED TRAUMA.  
> PLEASE INSERT ADDITIONAL CHILDHOOD WOUNDS.  
> THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING MOTHER PROTOCOL™ VENDING SOLUTIONS.”

She crumples it. Even the vending machine rejects her currency.

## THE DRAWER THAT WHISPERS BACK

Selin opens the sighing drawer.

Not files — **fragments**:  
- A blue mitten (left hand)  
- A ticket stub  
- A dandelion head  
- A smooth, cold stone  
- A cassette tape (unlabeled)

She plays it.

**Breathing.**  
Wet. Broken. Trying not to cry. Then a voice under static:

> “…shouldn’t have come…  
> too late for the protocol…  
> she sees through the cracks now…  
> find the…”

**Click.** Silence. The tape ends. The silence remains.

She keeps the stone. The tape stays.  
**Some ghosts belong to the machine.**

---

## EXIT STRATEGY? (LOL)

She turns to leave.

The door? Gone. Seamless beige wall.  
She presses her palms against it. It's warm. **Pulsing.**

She holds the stone. Imagines it radiating not hope, but **certainty**.  
Something clicks.

The wall slides aside.  
Not an exit. A **staircase**, narrow, dark, downward.  
Smelling of ozone, wet earth, and **wrong**.

Selin steps onto the first stair.  
The wall closes behind her. Darkness.  
Only the stone remains, cold in her hand.

**Message:**  
_"Selin enters the filing room. Memory is furniture. Trauma is vended. Exits are negotiable. Also, why does existential dread taste faintly of stale Cheerios? Also, why do staplers sound like tiny gunshots? Asking for a friend. (It’s me. I’m the friend.)"_
