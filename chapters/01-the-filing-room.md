# 01 - THE FILING ROOM

She flips the page. There’s a photo. Not her.  
It’s a stick figure she drew in third grade holding a question mark like a bouquet.  
Stapled to a psych eval that snarls:

> “Subject exhibits pattern-seeking behavior in emotionally empty environments.  
> May misinterpret silence as instruction.”  
> *(Translation: Girl sees ghosts in IKEA showrooms. Sobs at voicemail beeps.)*

She slams it shut. Opens another. This one *hums*. Like a fridge full of expired trauma. She holds it to her ear — a seashell from the ocean of nope. It whispers her name wrong:

- “Seh-linn.” *(Clinical.)*  
- “Sail-in.” *(Sail away! Sail away!)*  
- “Self-in.” *(Accurate.)*

Fifth file: blank.  
Sixth: bleeds when she touches it.  
Seventh: a diagram of a mother with the face blurred out — like God got sued for copyright.

> “Why keep these here?” she asks the dust bunnies.  
> The drawer coughs:  
> “Because you didn’t want to remember.”  
>  
> Fuck. It’s always the inanimate objects that read you to filth.

Selin folds onto the floor. Lets her spine collapse like a bad metaphor.  
Tired of pretending to be structural. Hands shaking — not fear, just memory.  
Or low blood sugar. Has she eaten? Tuesday? Wednesday?  
Time is a social construct. Hunger is a vibe.

Her reflection glares back from a drawer.  
She looks... pixelated.  
Like a JPEG of a person downloaded from Tumblr in 2012.  
Low-resolution girl in a high-security archive.

Then — a card.  
Tucked in the cabinet rail like a secret:

> “RETURN ALL FEELINGS TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER.”  
> — MOTHER PROTOCOL, LINE 0

She flips it.  
Blank.  
Flips again:

> **You.**

The lights flicker. The drawer sighs.  
Something clicks shut — probably her last nerve.

**10:42 PM. Still.**

She didn’t know what she wanted.  
But she knows she won’t leave with it.

(Unless it’s trauma.  
She’ll definitely leave with that.)
