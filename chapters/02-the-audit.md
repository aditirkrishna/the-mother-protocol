# CHAPTER 02 — THE AUDIT  
_Quantifying the Unquantifiable Shitshow_  
*(Scrawled by Rhyl at 4:17 AM, wearing one sock and the lingering scent of existential panic. The other sock? Vanished. Like childhood innocence. or coherent thought, and one eye on the existential abyss, the other on a half-eaten Pop-Tart that might be a metaphor. Or just breakfast. Hard to tell.)*  

The auditor’s office smelled like regret left in a damp basement and the sharp, chemical tang of naphthalene. Like bureaucratic decay wearing cheap cologne. Like regret processed through a fax machine.The single bulb overhead didn’t illuminate so much as accuse, casting long, guilty shadows. Flies – fat, sluggish, stupid – circled its sickly luminance. Every 23 seconds, exactly, a handful dropped dead onto the teetering pile of unpaid electricity bills stacked precariously on a filing cabinet labelled NOSTALGIA: DEPRECIATING ASSETS. Plip. Plip. Plip. Like a metronome for entropy.  

Selin didn’t answer immediately when he spoke her name. The name itself felt borrowed tonight, like library books overdue and accruing fines. Instead, she brushed her fingers across the back of her hand. Dry skin catching on dry skin. Then, she scrunched the right side of her upper lip – a tiny, internal seismograph. Whispered, barely audible, to the dust motes dancing in the accusation-light:  

“Is it already Wednesday?”  

She knew by the hair on her arms. Sharp. That’s how she felt the days. Oily hair slicked back? Saturday, definitely. The faint, gritty residue of dry shampoo clinging to her scalp like existential dandruff? Tuesday’s calling card. She traced the tiny, pointy hairs on her upper lip with the tip of her tongue. Pointy. That meant she’d somehow navigated past Thursday this week. A minor victory, celebrated internally with the fanfare of a deflating balloon.  

Her unibrow was starting its slow, inevitable knit back together. A fuzzy bridge across the frown line. Three-month mark. Last threading session: the day after her birthday. A cake uncut. No candles. Just the profound, suffocating silence and a plain, bone-white envelope from the Protocol, delivered by a drone that hummed like a disappointed parent. Inside, one line stamped in unforgiving black: “Emotional Clearance: Stable. Reassignable.” Like a used appliance passed on.  

“Selin?”  

The voice again. Softer this time. The impatience muffled beneath layers of bureaucratic fatigue. It belonged to the man hunched across the scarred metal desk. looked like a man who’d ironed his soul flat. His vest was grey. His tie was grey. His eyes were the colour of spreadsheet cells waiting for data that would never come. He didn’t sit at his desk; he manifested there, a bureaucratic spectrum haunting the ergonomic chair. His nameplate gleamed: SILAS THORNE - HE WHO TALLIES THE TEARS. His title: Maternal Linguist, Grade IV (Emotional Residue Division). His job: conducting the annual audit. Measuring the dust left behind when a mother is Protocol-issued and subsequently… withdrawn. Once a year, they came. To quantify the echo in the hollow.  

Selin had missed her last one. Fleeing? Forgetting? Folding herself into the static hum of an undocumentable life? Now, this room felt less like a place and more like a recurring dream she couldn’t quite shake. Did she remember the cracked linoleum? The dying flies? Or did the feeling just fit, like a worn slipper of dread?  

"Subject Selin M," Silas stated, voice devoid of modulation. A human text-to-speech engine running on dial-up. "Designation: Mother Protocol Candidate, Batch 7-Alpha. Status: Active Yet Undocumented. Compliance Rating: Catastrophically Withdrawn. You are present for Mandatory Emotional Residue Audit. Please assume the Quantification Posture."  

He gestured towards a contraption in the corner. It looked like a dentist’s chair mated with a lie detector and gave birth to something vaguely menacing. Wires snaked. Dials glowed an unhealthy green. A single, articulated arm ended in a suction cup large enough to cradle a human skull.  

"The what posture?" Selin rasped. Her voice felt like sandpaper on glass.  

"Posture C: Submissive-Receptive. Knees slightly bent. Spine at a 72-degree angle to the floor. Palms upturned, signifying metaphysical receptivity to fiscal scrutiny. Standard procedure." Silas consulted a laminated flowchart pinned to a corkboard. The corkboard wept tiny flakes of itself onto the grey carpet. "Failure to comply incurs penalty surcharges. Emotional interest compounds daily."  

“Isn’t it painful?” she asked. Not to him. To the space his sigh just occupied. To the naphthalene cloud hanging between them.  

He blinked. Slow. Like a lizard on a budget. “What do you mean?”  

“Do you believe in emotional residue?” She didn’t wait for his bureaucratic non-answer. “I think some feelings… calcify. Become heavier, more real, after the person leaves. Like stones sewn into the lining of your skin.”  

A pause. Thick. Sticky. Like flypaper for silence.  

She looked past him, past the grey vest smelling of mothballed memories, towards the far corner. Where cheap paint had peeled away from the damp wall in the perfect, aching shape of a missing photo frame. An empty rectangle screaming its absence.  

“Do you really think,” she continued, her voice scraping the bottom of its register, “I could love my mother… if she just… poof… appeared in front of me right now?” A bitter ghost of a smile touched her lips. “Magically reassigned?”  

She didn’t want his answer. That was the jagged little pill tearing at her insides. The part of her mind that kept asking questions it desperately didn’t want answered. Because the asking felt like a betrayal of the hollow space she’d learned to inhabit. Because the not-knowing was the only thing holding the fragile scaffolding of her self together. Because knowing might confirm something irreparable – that the hollow wasn't just empty, it was engineered.  

The Official Story (™️): Her mother gave her to the Protocol voluntarily. A sacrifice. For her own good. Salvation via severance.  
The Private Version: Her mother was emotionally removed. A distant satellite. Love on bureaucratic delay.  
The Secret Version (the one that flickered in her dreams, pixelated and rotting at the edges like bad fruit): That version didn’t need words. It just was. A silent, waiting weight in the dark.  

Selin hated herself. Hated the part that still, stupidly, craved the approval of the very system that made love feel like a hand-me-down. Transferable. Like a dress hanging in a charity shop window.  

"Like a dress," she murmured, the words tasting like dust and static. "You just had to wear it tight enough. Smile wide enough. And never, ever bleed through."  

The auditor – no name, just Vest – adjusted his… well, vest. The stiff lining crackled faintly, releasing another puff of chemical preservation. He tapped his pen – cheap, chewed – once, twice, against the manila folder resting unopened before him. SELIN VORA. Scribbled in fading blue ink. A coffee ring stain bloomed near the corner like a brown nebula. Spilled by him? By some other weary quantifier of ghosts? Who knew.  

“I’m not here to answer your questions, Subject Vora,” he stated, the monotone back, polished to a dull sheen. “This is an audit. Quantification. Not… therapy.” He said the word like it was something vaguely obscene found under a rock.  

Selin leaned back. The ancient metal chair beneath her groaned like a dying animal. Her eyes drifted back to the flickering bulb. Its light stuttered arrhythmically. Flicker. Hold. Flicker-flicker. Hold. Like the last gasps of a broken heart monitor. Or a bad Wi-Fi connection to the afterlife.  

He wrote something down. The scratch of pen on paper sounded obscenely loud in the fly-plagued silence. She didn’t look.  

“You said earlier,” he murmured, not looking up from his form, “that love felt transferable. Like a dress.” A pause. The pen hovered. “Do you still hold that position?”  

Selin watched a fly kamikaze into the hot glass of the bulb. Plip. Another statistic.  
“I don’t know,” she said, the words ash in her mouth. “But I think… I think I was dressed in someone else’s longing. Someone else’s unfinished business. And I…” She swallowed. The sharp hairs on her arm pricked. “I outgrew it.”  

The silence this time wasn't just thick. It was structural. Like the walls were holding their breath. Vest stopped writing. The pen tip rested heavily on the paper, threatening to bleed.  

She stared past him, through him, at the grey wall. Somewhere behind that cheap plaster and despair-coloured paint, there were wires. Insulation. Cold metal pipes. Things designed to carry energy, to contain warmth, hidden away, purely functional. Ultimately forgettable. Like the love she’d been allocated.  

The words clawed their way out, raw and unvarnished:  
“I don’t want a mother.”  
A beat. The flies hummed.  
“I want proof I wasn't accidentally loved.”  

Vest froze. The pen slipped from his fingers, clattering onto the metal desk like a dropped bone. He didn’t move to pick it up.  

“I want it to have been deliberate,” Selin continued, her voice low but cutting through the naphthalene haze. “A choice. Messy. Unreasonable. Ugly, maybe. But real. Not… not an administrative allocation. Not a box ticked on a Protocol form. Deliberate.”  

The only sound was the relentless plip of flies meeting their 23-second destiny and the frantic, failing heartbeat of the lightbulb above. Vest stared at his fallen pen. At the coffee stain on her folder. Anywhere but at her. The air crackled, not with machines, but with the unbearable weight of an audit that had just quantified something far beyond Guilt Tonnage or Melancholy Half-Life.  

It had quantified the shape of an absolute, screaming void.  

**Commit:** `02-the-audit/residue_of_the_deliberate_void`  
**Message:** "Audit conducted. Emotional residue: high. Proof of deliberate love: null. Flies still dying. Vest still smelling like grandpa's closet of regret. Also, why does existential dread billing always feel like getting audited by the ghost of an IRS agent who hated poetry? Asking for my therapist. (She’s billing me extra for this chapter.)"
