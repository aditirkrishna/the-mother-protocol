# CHAPTER 03 — THE WALL WOUND  
*(Scrawled on a diner napkin, 5 AM. Rain smears the window. Coffee’s gone asphalt-cold. The jukebox plays something mournful and twangy. Perfect.)*

Silas Thorne didn’t close the folder. He let it fall shut. A soft whump like a body hitting a mattress. The coffee stain bled through the manila, a Rorschach blot obscuring the ‘V’ in Vora. He didn’t look at Selin. He looked through the wall behind her, at something only the terminally bureaucratic could see – maybe the ghost of his own pension plan.

"Audit concluded," he rasped. Voice like grit caught in a drain. "Residual Melancholy: High. Guilt Tonnage: Significant. Capacity for Filial Attachment:…" His eyes – the colour of old dishwater – snagged on the texture of her. The sharp, Wednesday-verified hair on her forearms. The faint, persistent shadow of her unibrow, knitting itself back like a faulty scar. Three months. A fuzzy monument to the instability they couldn't quantify. "...Indeterminate. Reassignment Status: Hold."

Hold. The word didn't land. It sank. Like a stone into cold mud. Not freedom. Not punishment. A liminal purgatory. The conveyor belt jammed.

He stood. The grey vest sighed with the movement. He didn't offer forms. Didn't offer hope. He slid the folder into a drawer labelled PENDING: ATYPICAL. The label was peeling. He walked to the door – EXIT (EMOTIONAL NEUTRALITY REQUIRED) – paused. Not for her. For the weight of his own weariness. A grey smudge against the institutional beige. Gone.

The silence he left wasn't Silas-shaped. It was Selin-shaped. Hollow. Resonant with the echo of her own voice: Proof I wasn't accidentally loved. And the flies. Plip. Plip. Plip. Dying on schedule over the unpaid bills. Every 23 seconds. A tiny, relentless apocalypse.

Selin didn't move. She stared at the wall opposite. Not the missing photo frame shape. Lower. Where the cheap plaster met the skirting board. A place dampness loved. And there it was. Not peeling paint. A wound.

Long. Thin. Like a vertical mouth. Lips parted just slightly. Not bleeding. Weeping. A slow, viscous ooze the colour of weak tea. Not water. Something thicker. Sorrow? Regret? The building’s accumulated melancholia? It seeped silently onto the linoleum, forming a small, dark puddle that reflected the flickering bulb’s death throes.

She’d seen it last audit. Ignored it. Filed it under ‘hallucination: stress-induced’. Today, it pulsed. A slow, rhythmic throb. Glug. Glug. Counterpoint to the flies. Plip. Plip. 23 seconds.

## RHEAVEIRA’S KITCHEN (THE SMELL OF TURPENTINE & UNSPOKEN THINGS)
The smell hit like a physical thing: Turpentine. Sharp, medicinal, slicing through the lingering ghosts of last night’s cheap merlot and Miso’s sardine breath. Then, the sound: Rip. Tear. Scratch. Not charcoal. Rheaveira was attacking a canvas with a palette knife. Cadmium Red. Violent. Necessary.

Hair a chaotic nest secured by a single, paint-crusted chopstick. Leggings ripped at the knee. An old Sonic Youth shirt drowning under a leather apron spattered with battles fought and lost. Her face was set, jaw tight. Not concentration. Containment. Containing the societal static buzzing in her skull like a bad transformer. Selfish. Unnatural. Wasted. The whispers weren't words. They were the pressure behind her eyes, the tremor in the knife hand when she paused. Childless. By choice. A fortress built brick by brick against the expected narrative.

Riiiiip. She gouged a furrow through the red. Too deep? Fuck it. She stepped back, mug of stone-cold coffee forgotten. Her gaze wasn't assessing the canvas; it was interrogating it. Hunting the raw nerve beneath the pigment. Miso wove between her legs, a grounding, furry anchor.

The buzzer screamed. Harsh. Unignorable.

Rheaveira flinched. The palette knife clattered to the floor. "Jesus fuck." She glared at the intercom. Tuesday? No. Her agent knew the rules: No Surprises. She stomped over, paint-stained thumb jamming the button. "What?"

Silence. Then, a voice, thin, frayed, vibrating through the cheap speaker: "It’s… me."

Rheaveira knew. Knew the texture of that silence. The frayed edge. Selin. The girl who measured time in hair follicles and carried hollow spaces where mothers should be. She’d appeared once before, drenched and shaking after a "developmental suitability review." Rheaveira had handed her a towel and a shot of cheap whiskey. No questions. A middle finger to the Protocol’s sterile indifference.

She buzzed her in. The fortress gate creaked open.

## THE WALL WOUND SPEAKS (SORT OF)
Selin stood in the doorway. Backlit by the sickly hallway glow. She didn’t look pixelated. She looked frayed. Like cheap fabric pulled too tight. Wednesday screamed from the sharp hairs on her arms. Her Converse were caked in something damp and grey – street grime or… something else?

Rheaveira didn’t offer tea. Didn’t offer platitudes. She jerked her chin towards the chaos. "Sit. Or stand. Or vibrate. Whatever." A lifeline disguised as indifference. Practical. Undemanding.

Selin drifted in, a ghost drawn to the chaotic warmth. Her eyes skipped over the canvases, the books, Miso’s cautious sniffing. She didn’t sit. She hovered near the kitchen wall, opposite Rheaveira’s current battlefield. Her gaze fixed on a patch of plaster near the floor. A faint stain. Damp? Rheaveira hadn’t noticed it before.

"Silas Thorne," Selin said, the name dropping like a stone into the turpentine-scented air. "Put me on Hold."

Rheaveira paused, palette knife hovering over the wounded red canvas. "Hold?" The word tasted metallic. Wrong. "Since when do they Hold people? They Stable them. Reassign them. Discard them." Contempt, sharp as the knife.

Selin’s finger traced the air near the damp stain on the wall. Not touching it. Mapping it. "I asked him…" Her voice was scraped raw. "...for proof it wasn't an accident. The giving up. That it was… chosen."

Rheaveira’s breath hitched. Oh, kid. The brutal, beautiful audacity of that ask. Not a plea for a mother. A demand for meaning in the void. Proof the wound was deliberate. Proof the hollow had intent carved into it. Her gaze snapped to Selin’s face, then followed her finger to the wall stain. It looked… different now Selin was looking at it. Less like damp, more like… seepage. A slow, silent weeping from the building’s bones.

"Proof like that," Rheaveira said, her voice low, gravel scraping bone, "doesn't live in Thorne’s fucking folders. Or his vest." She gestured violently with the palette knife, splattering crimson droplets onto the floor. Miso darted away. "It lives here." She tapped her own temple, hard. "And here." She jabbed the knife towards her chest. "And maybe… there." She pointed the knife tip at the damp stain Selin couldn’t look away from. "In the shit the building cries when no one’s listening."

Silence. Thick. Charged. Selin finally tore her gaze from the wall wound. Looked at Rheaveira. Really looked. Saw the lines of defiance etched deep, the exhaustion, the furious, protective energy radiating off her like heat from a kiln. Not a mother. A bulwark. A fellow excavator in the ruins of expectation.

"Does it… talk?" Selin whispered, nodding towards the stain. "Yours?"

Rheaveira barked a laugh, short and harsh. "Fuck no. Mine screams. In abstract. Mostly red." She tossed the palette knife onto a nearby table. It landed with a clatter. "Yours?"

Selin looked back at the stain. It seemed to pulse faintly in the afternoon light. Glug. "It weeps," she said simply. "Quietly. Like it’s ashamed."

Rheaveira didn’t flinch. Didn’t call her crazy. She walked to the fridge, yanked it open. Pulled out two cheap beers. Popped the tops with the edge of her apron. Handed one to Selin. "To the weeping walls," she said, clinking her bottle against Selin’s. "And the shit they can't say."

They drank. The beer was bitter, cheap. The silence wasn't comfortable. It was real. The mystery wasn't sci-fi or gothic. It was:

**The Hold**: Why Indeterminate? Why Hold? Was it Selin’s question? Was it Silas Thorne cracking? Or was the Protocol itself sensing the Wall Wound – the unquantifiable melancholia seeping through the cracks?

**The Resonance**: Why did Selin’s feet find this door? Why did Rheaveira’s fortress open? Why did Selin see the weeping wall when Rheaveira only saw damp? A shared frequency tuned to systemic sorrow?

**The Unnamed Pact**: What was this? Sharing cheap beer over architectural grief? Rheaveira’s red fury meeting Selin’s quiet seepage? It wasn’t mothering. It was mutual recognition. A silent agreement: I see your damage. Mine is different, but it bleeds the same colour.

Selin took another swig. The sharpness in her eyes was still there, but softened by the beer’s cold bite and the sheer, unexpected normality of sharing damage with someone who didn’t flinch. Rheaveira picked up a charcoal nub, not looking at her canvas. She sketched a quick, rough line on the wall next to the damp stain. A vertical slash. Mouth-like. Simple. An acknowledgment.

The mystery deepened. Not with ghosts or birdcages. With the quiet glug of a wall weeping onto cheap linoleum, the hiss of a beer bottle opening, and the silent understanding that some proofs aren't found in files. They’re felt in the shared space where the walls aren't soundproof, and the damage leaks through.
