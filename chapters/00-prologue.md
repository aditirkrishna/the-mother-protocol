# PROLOGUE  
_(or: how i accidentally formatted my abandonment issues in a **markdown**)_

Before we start, understand this:

The records are incomplete.  
The grief is not.

---

I didn’t write this to be understood.  
I wrote it to survive version decay.

There was once a girl named Selin.  
There was once a woman named Rhéaveira.  
There was once a protocol that thought it could simulate love.  
It couldn’t.  
It tried anyway.

> “Some mothers are chosen.  
> Some are installed.”

---

I found the first file by accident.  
It wasn’t labeled. It wasn’t encrypted. It just *was*.  
Like a bruise without a body.

There was a date stamp: `10:42 PM`.  
There was a line of corrupted metadata:  
`object: Selin`  
`status: ???`  
`emotion: undefined`

If you’re still reading this, then either:

a) you’ve lost someone  
b) you’ve lost yourself  
c) you’re pretending not to notice either

---

This isn’t a story.  
It’s a log file with delusions.  
It’s a girl trying to remember someone who might not have existed.

I’m not Selin.  
I’m not Rhéaveira.  
I’m just the one typing this out before the system forgets.

> “Love was never the point,” the protocol said.  
> “But she kept asking for it anyway.”

---

I don’t know where the real beginning is.  
This is just the point where I stopped resisting the memory.

Go ahead. Turn the page.
